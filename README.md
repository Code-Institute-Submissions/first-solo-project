# First Milestone Project #

This web application is built with the theme of luxury yacht sales. The website showcases some luxury yachts for sale 
aswell as features to improve the user experience when browsing. The footer has links to the companies social media so that the user can find updates for example.

There are multiple forms that the user can access, the first being a register/sign in section "Customer Lounge" where the user can access enter their details.
 The next being a finance page where the user can apply for finance using a similar function.
 
 Lastly a contact us page is available so the user can easily get in touch with the company.
 
 The whole application encorporates the "Mobile-First approach"  which is why on smaller devices the application is modified to the users device.
## UX ##

This project is for users who are seeking luxury yachts. 

The user wants to be able to look through a catalogue of yachts, and then enquire about the yacht by contacting the company. The "ships" page and "finance" page allows the user to achieve this goal.



I built a wireframe using Balsamiq Mockups 3:

### Features ###

- The home page has an enticing message with an arrow leading the user into the main content of the page.
- The Navigatgion bar has smooth animations to provide a much more elegant user experience.
- The ships section of the application allows the user to select a ship they desire and A: enquire about the ship B: watch a video tour (not yet implemented as the content for this feature is not available.)
- The Customer Lounge has a section which allows users to submit data in 2 forms. The first being a sign in form (which eventually will allow users to sign in and track exisiting finance plans however this feature is beyond the scope of this milestone). The second being a register form allowing users to register to the site. (similarly this feature still needs to be fully implemented.)
- The Finance page allows users to imput data into the fields and submit (however the back-end processing of this feature still needs to be implemented).
- The Contact us page has 2 clickable icons which provide the user with an alert containing information on how to contact the company, this feature specificially targets mobile users.
- The footer has an icon which will take the user to www.metoffice.co.uk to check weather reports for sailing.
- The footer also contains links to the companies social media sites so that the user can keep up with the companies news.
